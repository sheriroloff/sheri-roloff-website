						<h2>Content Strategy for SaaS</h2>
						<p>
							As the Content Strategist at Amla Commerce, I led the development of content for complex SaaS products, 
							including Znode, an enterprise B2B ecommerce platform, and Artifi, an end-to-end product customization platform.
						</p>
						<p>
							I drove content for 360 campaigns, including 
							<a href="https://www.znode.com/insights/introducing-b-stores/" 
							target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog posts</a>, 
							case studies, press releases, social posts, video scripts, 
							<a href="https://www.znode.com/b-stores/" 
							target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">landing pages</a>, 
							<a href="https://www.znode.com/insights/grow-2023-recap/" 
							target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in-person events</a>, and more.
						</p>
						<p>
							Through market research and persona development, I developed and executed content strategies designed to elevate 
							Amla’s product positioning and brand identity. Znode’s new brand videos are an excellent top-of-funnel example. 
							In addition to strategy and creative concepting, I wrote the script and performed the voiceover.

						<h2>Corporate Voice & Brand Development</h2>
						<p>
							As Direct Supply’s Corporate Communication Manager and Content Strategist, I was responsible for evolving and 
							maintaining Direct Supply’s corporate voice and brand narrative across channels. Here are a few examples.
						</p>
						<p>
							I wrote and designed ads for Direct Supply’s corporate ad placements across magazines, catalogs, websites, 
							LinkedIn, Google ads and more. Here’s an example of a 
							<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GxqCfZbYPSfi1Xr9KlDUfc7t0bOYJ1kL/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">full spread ad</a>
							that I wrote and designed for a print catalog.
						</p>
						<p>
							In partnership with Direct Supply’s executives and national accounts sellers, I developed and drove visual 
							narratives to push customer conversations to the next level. I became the go-to problem-solver for transforming 
							complex topics into easy-to-understand words and visuals.

						</p>
						<p>
							This 20-page brochure shows the full spectrum of Direct Supply’s offering and was designed to be a sales 
							presentation tool as well as a high-impact leave-behind after customer meetings. I was responsible for 
							creating and driving the strategy and execution of this brochure to ensure it not only met the existing 
							needs of our sales team, but also elevated Direct Supply’s story to meet future-focused goals.

						<h2>"How to Live" Short Film</h2>
						<p>
							I wrote a song and developed an on-screen story to showcase the unique ways seniors and caregivers 
							enhance each other's lives. I composed the music and lyrics, performed vocals and piano on the 
							recording, and directed members of the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra to record the accompanying 
							string arrangement I wrote. I also created storyboards, selected the on-screen talent, and provided 
							creative direction on set. The result is an award-winning short film that celebrates Direct Supply’s 
							customers and seniors in Long Term Care.

						<h2>Senior Living Stories Campaign</h2>
						<p>
							I provided creative direction for Direct Supply’s “Spirit of Caring” film series 
							centered around incredible stories in the Senior Care industry. I traveled to meet 
							customers in person and ensure we captured the heart of their stories, personalities 
							and relationships with seniors in the communities they serve. I led the creative 
							output for the launch of the campaign which included customer-submitted stories, 
							web pages, emails and supporting ads.

						<h2>Senior Housing Survey White Paper</h2>
						<p>
							In partnership with the Developers Collective, Direct Supply conducted a survey 
							of senior housing prospects. I worked with the survey creator to extrapolate 
							actionable insights, designed a fast facts infographic and designed the full 
							38-page white paper, which served as a gated content piece to drive leads.

							This video was created to honor the important roles of healthcare
